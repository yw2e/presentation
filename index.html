    <h1>BRC-20 Presentation</h1>
    <p>BRC-20 is an experimental token standard on the bitcoin ecosystem that allows for minting and transferring of fungible tokens on the ordinals protocol. They were introduced by Domo (programmer) in march 23 following the inception and launch of bitcoin ordinals in january 23. These tokens function by utilizing ordinals inscriptons of JSON data on satoshis, that's what enables contract deployment, minting and transfer of tokens. This narrative is relatively experimental and new and as such there are limited tools to navigate around it at the moment. The first was ORDI and many other memebased brc-20s have followed since.  </p>
